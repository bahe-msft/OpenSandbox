# AKS Changelogs

This file tracks AKS-specific changes carried by the `aks-dev` branch relative to `opensandbox-group/main`. Keep entries in reverse chronological order and include a pull request or commit reference plus a one-sentence description.

## Release process

1. Add new AKS-local changes under `Unreleased` as PRs merge into `aks-dev`.
2. When cutting an AKS dev snapshot, choose a tag in the form `aksdev/YYYYMMDD` (for example, `aksdev/20260726`). If multiple snapshots are cut on the same day, append a numeric suffix such as `aksdev/20260726-1`.
3. Move the relevant `Unreleased` entries into a new section named for that tag.
4. Merge the changelog update, then create and push the tag from the desired `aks-dev` commit:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout aks-dev
   git pull --ff-only origin aks-dev
   git tag -a aksdev/20260726 -m "AKS dev 20260726"
   git push origin aksdev/20260726
   ```

5. Publish AKS images with the same AKS tag. Docker image tags cannot contain `/`, so image publishing sanitizes `aksdev/20260726` to `aksdev-20260726` when composing image tags.
